## Features
- Two types of users: regular and admin. Administrator users can monitor all user activity. They also have full access to editing regular user schedules, for moderation purposes.
- Users may also log in using their Google account
- Users can create schedules and tasks. Schedules can be set to public, which allows other users and unregistered site visitors to view them.
- Tasks are stored independently from schedules, so a recurring task can be added to multiple schedules.
